			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p><b>Dataset: </b> Every 10 years, the census documents the demographic make-up of the U.S. Population, accounting for gender and age of individuals. The age is accounted for by 5 year segments from 0 to 90+, and sex is reported as a binary, male and female. The data serves as a comparison of the demographics between 1900 and 2000.</p>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to design a line chart to better emphasize the change in population numbers, small increases and decreases for each age segment, between different genders and 1900 vs. 2000. </li>
				<li>With a line plot, we can also see especially the male vs. female lines intersecting with each other, or age groups where the number of male vs. female were the same. </li>
				<li>In addition, I decided to plot both 1900 and 2000, male and female on this plot in order to get a comprehensive view on how population breakdown has changed. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to design a pie chart in order to visualize the breakdown of age group for 1900 and 2000. </li>
				<li>I also summed the male and female sex numbers together to calculate percentages, in order to get an idea of the age breakdown across the whole population. </li>
				<li>While a line chart, does show the population numbers across age groups, the pie chart offers insight of these population numbers with respect to each other, and what percentage of the population 1 age group with respect to the whole population. </li>
				<li>Although there might have been a way to combine the 2 pie charts together, I believe this would have made the chart quite complicated to understand undermining the purpose of visualizing the age distribution. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to create a multi-dimension bar chart, where the zero-axis is in the middle to represent how male and female population numbers have differed in comparison to each other. </li>
				<li>I believe its interesting how in 1900 on average there are higher number of females than males, however in 2000 there are higher number of males earlier on in life, however for larger age groups there’s considerable larger number of females. </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Based on the three sketches, we can gather that for the United States, the percentage of the population within older age brackets is much less in comparison to younger age brackets for both the years 1900 and 2000. While this trend might appear expected, in countries like Japan a substantial portion of their population is actually in the older age brackets. Furthermore, when exploring life expectancy differences between genders, the bar chart indicates a predominance of females in 2000, contrasting to a more balanced distribution between genders in 1900, specifically in older age groups. For example in the 75-age segment, there were over 1,450 more females than males in 2000, yet in 1900, females were 50 fewer than males. Although this discrepancy could be attributed to the overall smaller population in the 1900s, it’s interesting to note that certain age groups in 1900 also had an equal number of males and females, like 0, 80 and 90. In the year 2000, despite a general increase in female population over males, this gap widens significantly in the elderly, suggesting that women generally have higher life expectancy then males.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>

				In my final visual, I decided to draw inspiration from my third sketch, the multidimensional bar chart, to explore changes in life expectancy from 1900 to 2000 between genders. I decided to use a multidimensional bar char with a central 0 axis because I felt it best showcases the differences in population between males and females and how these differences span across various age groups and between 1900 and 2000. Placing the two bars next to each other for each time period also highlighted the direct comparison across ages, represented along the x-axis. 

				A challenge I ran into when designing this plot was how to make highlight the age segments for each set of bars. Initially at the sketching stage, I labeled the age segments directly on the x-axis, however this proved to be cluttered and difficult to read. Ultimately, I decided to label the age brackets at the top and drew lines down to the corresponding bars so that the age brackets were clearly legible and also easy to distinguish between them. In addition, while I thought about labeling each bar with its respective year, I ultimately relied on color coding and a legend to differentiate the years - I believe the color highlighted the difference well and adding the years would have simply made the chart more cluttered.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I expanded on my design choices for this bar chart above, but my final visualization also expands on the question I focused on: life expectancy and how it differed between 1900 and 2000 and genders. The height of the bars for age brackets for 2000 demonstrate the disparity between males and females, especially as individuals get older. For instance, at age 50 in 2000, there were 400 more females than males, however this difference increased to 1,400 for age 70. This gender disparity can’t be attributed to a predominance of older individuals, since younger age groups made up a larger portion of the US population for both 1900 and 2000. In contrast, 1900 showed a more balanced gender distribution across most age groups. The exception was the Middle Ages, for instance at the age group 40 there were 300 less females than males. Conducting some background research into this, part of the reason why there are less females than males especially in the middle age groups were there was a larger umber of male immigrants than female. Although a smaller disparity, we can also note in 1900, there were 50 more females than males in both the 80 and 85 age group, implying that in 1900 females also had a relatively higher life expectancy than males. In addition as one might expect with advancements in science and medicine, the overall life expectancy in 1900 was lower than 2000 - evidence of this is the net 0 population for the 90 age bracket for 1900 and over 1,400 for 2000.

		Exploring different data representations has been helpful in understanding which would prove to be the most effect to understand life expectancy differences by gender and over time. Sketching various chart types encouraged us to think about unique ways of representing the data, and moving beyond instinctive choices like line graphs for complex data sets. Also for me, this process emphasized the value of more innovating charting styles for reveling more interesting data insights.
