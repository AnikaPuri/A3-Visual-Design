			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p><b>Dataset: </b> Every 10 years, the census documents the demographic make-up of the U.S. Population, accounting for gender and age of individuals. The age is accounted for by 5 year segments from 0 to 90+, and sex is reported as a binary, male and female. The data serves as a comparison of the demographics between 1900 and 2000.</p>

				<figcaption>
					Line Plot representing the number of individuals in each age group across male and female genders and 1900 and 2000.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to design a line chart to better emphasize the change in population numbers, small increases and decreases for each age segment, between different genders and 1900 vs. 2000. </li>
				<li>With a line plot, we can also see especially the male vs. female lines intersecting with each other, or age groups where the number of male vs. female were the same. </li>
				<li>In addition, I decided to plot both 1900 and 2000, male and female on this plot in order to get a comprehensive view on how population breakdown has changed. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="PieChart.jpg" width = "700" height = auto/>
				<figcaption>
          Pie Chart represented the age distribution for the entire population (both male and female genders) in 1900 vs. 2000. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to design a pie chart in order to visualize the breakdown of age group for 1900 and 2000. </li>
				<li>I also summed the male and female sex numbers together to calculate percentages, in order to get an idea of the age breakdown across the whole population. </li>
				<li>While a line chart, does show the population numbers across age groups, the pie chart offers insight of these population numbers with respect to each other, and what percentage of the population 1 age group with respect to the whole population. </li>
				<li>Although there might have been a way to combine the 2 pie charts together, I believe this would have made the chart quite complicated to understand undermining the purpose of visualizing the age distribution. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="BarChart.jpg" width = "700" height = auto/>
				<figcaption>
          Bar Chart representing the comparison between 1900 and 2000 for how many more female individuals than male for each age segment.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to create a multi-dimension bar chart, where the zero-axis is in the middle to represent how male and female population numbers have differed in comparison to each other. </li>
				<li>I believe its interesting how in 1900 on average there are higher number of females than males, however in 2000 there are higher number of males earlier on in life, however for larger age groups there’s considerable larger number of females. </li>
			</ul>
